# Cryptographic-Hash-Implementation

Implementation of SHA 512.

No external modules required. 

To build
```python sha.py``` 
or
```py sha.py```
depending on your system.

The program runs through 5 tests automatically and verifies the computed result with the actual result. If you want to generate hash value for custom input, uncomment and change `m` in the main block.
